# WordPress.com Styles

Initial work for what may become a handy dandy style guide full of all sorts of goodies.

## CSS
	### BEM
Let's try this BEM thing. Initially, I tried block_element-modifier, but I like the ability to hyphen separate words in an element.

Syntax:  ``.block__element--modifier``
Example: ``.wpcom-header__site-title--gigantor``

Why two underscores?
Readability. It's easier to scan through BEM with the extra gap.
